# Enemies / EnemiesNoSync
This module contains the enemy descriptors. The name of the module can be either `Enemies` or `EnemiesNoSync`, but never both at the same time. The choice of which to use depends on if you want your difficulty to be pubbable, that is, to be played with players that do not have CD2 installed:

* Some CD2 features require being replicated to the clients, such as the `Scale` enemy control or the customization of enemy looks (materials). `Enemies` can replicate these characteristics to players, but in exchange it will force the clients to use CD2 or they will suffer a disconnect upon mission start. 
* `EnemiesNoSync` doesn't do replication to clients. A difficulty with `EnemiesNoSync` is compatible with all clients, regardless of whether they use CD1, CD2 or nothing at all. When you use `EnemiesNoSync` you are implicitly stating that you didn't use any features that require replication.

To see which features require the `Enemies` module, please check the following guide by @Spy: [On Pubbing With CD2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ShytNpPJF56XojjrTofA9DCkBXCzqBH2W-aFaLgbk30/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ithv7n4jcboa).

| WeakpointHP               | Float           | |

### `Heal` advanced mode
`Heal` can accept the following advanced settings:

+ `InitialRate`: sets the initial healing if positive or bleed if negative. 
+ `FinalRate`: sets the value that will be used after `SwitchAfter` time has passed.
+ `SwitchAfter`: the time at which the `FinalRate` will be used. Starts counting on enemy spawn. 

### `Outline` special control 
This module allows to give a permanent outline to an enemy, as if someone had pinged it. It is usually used to mark dangerous enemies like breeders or ranged threats so you can see them through walls. It accepts two fields: `Enable`, which accepts a boolean, and `Type`, which accepts one of the following: `Enemy` (red outline, default), `Friendly`, `Neutral` and `Item`.  

### `Direct` special control 

`Direct` allows to directly change enemy properties as defined in UE4. Many properties that are not directly exposed
by CD2 can be changed with `Direct`. For example:

```json
"ED_Spider_ExploderTank": {
    "Direct": {
        "Int:NumClusterBombs": 200 
    }
}
```

```json 
"ED_Spider_Exploder": {
  "Movement": {
    "MaxPawnSpeed": 5,
    "MaxAcceleration": 5,
    "MaxBrakingDeceleration": 10,
    "AlignDirectionSpeed": 10,
    "AlignToTargetMinRequiredAngle": 1,
    "StrafeSpeed": 5
  },
  "Direct": {
    "PCol:Mesh": true
  },
  "CanPlayerStandOn": true,
  "Alert": true
}
```

```json 
"ED_JellyBreeder": {
  "Direct": {
    "Bool:Capsule.bHiddenInGame": false,
    "PCol:Capsule": true
  },
  "CanPlayerStandOn": true
}
```

### Elite variants for all enemies

Setting `Elite` to true or to some float number will only work directly for those enemies that have a vanilla elite variant: guards, grabbers, praetorians, bulks, menaces and trijaws. For the rest of the enemies, an elite base must be specified by setting `ForceEliteBase` to some existing ED that has an elite variant. As an example, the following snippet creates an elite septic spreader, which won't work without the `ForceEliteBase`:

```json
"ED_Elite_Septic_Spreader": {
    "Base": "ED_Spider_Lobber",
    "Elite": true,
    "ForceEliteBase": "ED_Grabber"
}
```

The type of elite specified as base can modify the characteristics of your custom elite descriptor, feel free to experiment. 

### Veteran control 

Veterans allow some enemies to promote to other enemies. In vanilla the veteran classes are hardcoded (for example, oppressors are praetorians that got promoted with a probability given by the `VeteranLarge` setting in [DifficultySetting](modules.md)). CD2 improves the system by allowing the player to create their own custom veteran classes. There are currently two ways to interact with the veteran system:

* `VeteranClasses` accepts a list of descriptors that the base descriptor can promote to. `VeteranClasses` uses `VeteranNormal` probablities unless `UsesVeteranLarge` is set to true. The following snippet shows an example:

```json
"DifficultySetting": {
    "VeteranNormal": {
        [
        "Weight": 1,
        "Min": 0.2, 
        "Max": 0.2
        ]
    }
},
"Enemies": {
    "ED_Spider_Grunt": {
        "VeteranClasses": [
            "ED_Spider_Shooter",
            "ED_Spider_Spitter"
        ]
    }
}
```

With these settings, Grunts will promote to acid and web spitters with a 20 % chance each time they spawn. One disadvantage of this approach is that `VeternalNormal` and `VeteranLarge` are global.

* The second way is `CustomVeterans`, which bypasses the `VeternalNormal` and `VeteranLarge` settings and lets the user specify the probability directly. The following snippet whould work exactly as the one before, but now the probabilities are contained to the grunt descriptor instead of being global:

```json
"ED_Spider_Grunt": {
     "CustomVeterans": {
        "ED_Spider_Grunt": 0.8,
        "ED_Spider_Shooter": 0.1,
        "ED_Spider_Spitter": 0.1
      }
    }
```

`CustomVeterans` also allows specifying a mutator to decide which enemies to spawn, which can give more control. One useful use case is to limit the amount of veterans of a certain type:

```json 
"ED_Spider_Grunt": {
      "CustomVeterans": {
        "Mutate": "RandomChoice",
        "Choices": [ "ED_Spider_Buffer", "ED_Spider_Grunt", "ED_Spider_Grunt_Guard", "ED_Spider_Grunt_Attacker" ],
        "Weights": [
          {
            "Mutate": "IfFloat",
            "Value": { "Mutate": "EnemyCount", "ED": "ED_Spider_Buffer" },
            "<": 5,
            "Then": 30,
            "Else": 0
          },
          1,
          1,
          1
        ]
      }
    },
```

This snippet gives a very high chance of wardens to spawn until there are 5 of them in the map, at which point the probability to get more warden promotions will drop to 0.

### Custom materials

CD2 allows specifying a list of `Materials` in individual enemy descriptors to customize how the enemies look. This feature requires `Enemies` for clients to be able to see the changes.

Example: create an orange septic.

```json 
{
    "Enemies": {
        "ED_Spider_Lobber": {
            "Materials": ["M_Halloween_Light_Orange", "M_Halloween_Light_Orange"]
        }
    }
}

```
<figure markdown="span">
  ![CD2modhub](pictures/orange-septic.png)
</figure>


Each enemy has a certain number of material slots. There are hundreds of available materials, but not all of them work when used in enemies. The best way to test and find new materials for your enemies is spawning the enemy in [Sandbox Utilities](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/sandbox-utilities) and changing them, and you will be able to see the change in real time. This procedure is explained in [this document](media/Materials-1.pdf) by @TheBrain.
If you wish to leave a slot with the default material, both `""` and `Default` work.

## Spawner

`Spawner` is a special submodule that allows any enemy to periodically spawn other enemies with different flexilibity options. It contains the following fields:

| Name               | Description                                                                                 | Default |

The following snippet shows a stingtail descriptor with a swarmer module attached. The spawner will spawn 2 swarmers every second until 10 are alive and they will all die when the stingtail is killed:

```json 
"ED_Spider_Stinger": {
    "Spawner": {
        "ED": "ED_Spider_Spawn",
        "IntervalSpawnCount": 2,
        "Interval": 1,
        "OnDeathCount": 0,
        "MaxSpawns": 10,
        "OnDeathKillSpawns": true
    }
}
```

All fields inside the `Spawner` can be mutated.

## Temperature
Special temperature controls to change how enemies react to heat and cold.

| Name                   | Type    |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| DieIfFrozen            | Boolean |
| DieIfBurning           | Boolean |
| IsHeatsourceWhenOnFire | Boolean |
| OnFireHeatRange        | Float   |
| BurnTemperature        | Float   |
| DouseFireTemperature   | Float   |
| FreezeTemperature      | Float   |

| FozenDamageBonusScale  | Float   |
| MaxColdSlowdown        | Float   |

Example: the following snippet use the `Temperature` module to make dreadnoughts ignitable.

```json
{ 
    "Enemies": {
        "ED_Spider_Boss_Heavy": {
          "Resistances": {"DamageMultiplier": 1.23, "FireDamageMultiplier": 1.2},
          "Temperature": {"BurnTemperature": 100, "DouseFireTemperature": 50}
        },
        "ED_Spider_Boss_TwinA": {
          "Resistances": {"DamageMultiplier": 1.3, "FireDamageMultiplier": 1.2},
          "Temperature": {"BurnTemperature": 100, "DouseFireTemperature": 50}
        },
        "ED_Spider_Boss_TwinB": {
