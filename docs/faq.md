# CD2 FAQ

* **Q: Where can I get the mod?**
* A: The mod right now is in open beta and the .pak file can be found in the Practical DRG discord server. The mod integration loader is recommended.
<br/>
* **Q: Can I use this at the same time as CD1?**
* A: No. Only enable one CD version at a time.
<br/>
* **Q: How can I use this?**
* A: Drag and drop the zip file into MINT and press install mods. You do not need to extract the pak from the zip to install.
<br/>
* **Q: Do clients need CD2 to play in my CD2 lobby?**
* A: Clients only need CD2 if you use certain features. For instance, difficulties that use the Enemies module will require that all clients have CD2. If the EnemiesNoSync is used instead, clients will no longer need CD2. 
<br/>
* **Q: Why aren't my original cd difficulties compatible with CD2?**
* A: Custom Difficulty v2 is a complete redesign. It uses top level names to denote independent modules. For this reason, many previous top-level fields were moved into modules.
<br/>
* **Q: Does CD2 support more than 4 players?**
* A: Yes CD2 has complete support for more than 4 player lobbies. Any player-count depedent field can be extended to any number of players. Additionally, you can specify `MaxPlayers: 8` in your difficulty to set the max players count.
<br/>
* **Q: Will changing the difficulty mid mission break the game like in CD1?**
* A: No. That has not been observed in any of the testing so far.
<br/>
* **Q: Is this compatible with MEV?**
* A: Yes, this is fully compatible with MEV!
